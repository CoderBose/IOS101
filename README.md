## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications:
1. Marcus - A Savings account by Goldman Sachs. I love that it has a smooth and easy to understand UI, with perfectly balanced colors. It has an unique quote every single time and also, allows me to log in with the help of Face ID.
2. Spotify - The best music application, in my humble opinion. It comes up with the perfect recommendations for my music, and I love the "smart shuffle" functionality, where it shuffles from random music, but similar genres.
3. Photos app on iPhone - I love organizing things in general, so I absolutely love the way albums can be auto-created if the phone detects, I was in a certain place for some duration. The highlight reels are also magical and have my heart.

Application Idea:
In creating my iOS app, I want to make a space where people don't have to "come out" about their identity. It's like a cool, judgment-free zone where users can share pictures and be themselves without facing criticism. The app has strong rules to keep things safe, allowing users to control who sees their stuff. There's also a chat area for friendly talks and info to help everyone understand different experiences. The goal is to make this app super user-friendly and keep improving it based on what people want.

In addition to the LGBTQ+ inclusivity and body positivity, my app aims to create a space where people can freely express themselves without judgment in various aspects. It addresses judgment around mental health, letting users share their experiences and support each other. Furthermore, the app promotes cultural inclusivity, encouraging users to celebrate their backgrounds without fear of prejudice. By fostering a sense of acceptance, the platform seeks to break down barriers related to age, allowing people from different generations to connect and learn from each other.

My app aims to create a space where people can freely express themselves without judgment in various aspects, including mental health. The platform also encourages users to celebrate their cultural backgrounds without fear of prejudice. Another crucial aspect is tackling ageism, fostering a sense of acceptance for individuals of all ages. This ensures that elders are not only acknowledged but celebrated, providing a platform for intergenerational connections where different age groups can learn from and support each other. The goal is to break down societal barriers and create an inclusive environment that respects the diverse aspects of people's lives.

## Notes

I hadn't used XCode for iOS development before, so finding the specific windows like the "Connections Inspector" took a little time, but it worked out just fine.
